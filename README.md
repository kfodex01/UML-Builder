# UML-Builder
A text-based UML Builder

This project was completed as a capstone project at WGU.

The purpose of the capstone project was to create a program which could be used to generate a text based version of a Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram. A traditional UML diagram acts as a visual flowchart. It is used primarily in the planning process, but can also be used during quality control processes to verify that the code written adheres to the proposed project’s design.

Unfortunately, this type of diagram is hard to use for quality control purposes. With a complex program, a visual UML diagram can easily appear as a jumbled mess. The capstone project attempts to alleviate this issue.

The capstone program is a text-based, UML diagram builder. The user is able to enter steps into the program. Each step can be edited, deleted, and reordered. The user is also able to add decision trees which affect the step order. Once the UML diagram is complete, the user can walk through the process one step at a time. The user is responsible for advancing to the next step by hitting a key. This way, it is not possible for the programmer to lose their place in the diagram. In addition, by displaying each step one at a time, the overall layout of the process is hidden from the user, allowing them to focus on the content of each step. In this way, the complexity of the program’s workflow can be more easily digested.

Overall, the creation of the capstone program progressed well. The planning document written for this project helped map out all the goals and objectives that needed to be reached for this project to be completed. The planning process saw the creation of a class diagram for the capstone program. This resulted in the program’s classes being properly thought out and encapsulated. This is the primary reason the project was completed ahead of schedule even though production started a day later than anticipated. The only stumbling block was during the creation of a large section of navigation code. This block resulted in a couple hours of troubleshooting, which probably could have been avoided using different practices. There were a few changes implemented after programming was under way. Once the objectives were completed and all changes implemented, the program was considered complete and the project was brought to a successful close.
